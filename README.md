# Edgar Analysis Solution
### 1. My approach to the problem
This coding challenge asks us to read the log file line by line and by using a
predefined inactivity time to determine how long a session is and how many
documents were accessed by the user (by their IP address) in that session.

Since we are not allowed to read the whole file at once, I read in one line at
a time.
